# qemuprint

This library prints text to the [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) emulator's serial port on the `virt` RISC-V machine target. This crate is used by [Diosix](https://diosix.org) for debugging during system startup. It can also be used by non-std libraries that need to output debugging and diagnostic information during development.

If you wish to use this for your own project, let me know and I'll tidy up the documentation and API.
